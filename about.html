        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>Born and raised in the Chicagoland area, I am excited to learn from and contribute to Seattle’s burgeoning tech community. Starting out as an engineer in the medical device industry, I honed my abilities for problem solving and identifying user needs by day, and taught myself to code by night. Awakened to the powerful ways programming integrated into the world around me, I applied to <strong><a href="https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/" class="yellow" target="_blank">Ada Developers Academy</a></strong>’s intensive program, bought a one-way ticket from Chicago to Seattle, and embarked on a more professional and committed relationship with coding.
        <br/><br/>
        Through Ada Developers Academy, I rediscovered my creativity through problem solving and design as I trained in full-stack web development with Ruby, Rails, HTML/CSS, and Javascript for 6 months. I completed the program with a 5-month internship at Microsoft. I then completed a 3-month apprenticeship through Microsoft's <strong><a href="http://www.industryexplorers.com/" class="yellow" target="_blank">LEAP</a></strong>, where I was able to polish my skills in C# and Visual Studio, as well as learn C++.
        <br/><br/>
        I am amazed by how having the skill of knowing how to code and how to <em>learn</em> to code can lead to so many powerful applications and wonderful avenues of communication. I am always open to working with organizations dedicated to diversity and investment in new talent, and I look forward to working in an environment where I am constantly learning and becoming a master at my craft.
        <br/><br/>

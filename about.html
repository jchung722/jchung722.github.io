        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>Born and raised in the Chicagoland area, I am excited to learn from and contribute to Seattle’s burgeoning tech community. Starting out as an engineer in the medical device industry, I honed my abilities for problem solving and identifying user needs by day, and taught myself to code by night. Awakened to the powerful ways programming applied in the world around me, I applied to <a href="https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a>’s intensive program, bought a one-way ticket from Chicago to Seattle, and embarked on a more professional and committed relationship with coding.
        <br/><br/>
        Through Ada Developers Academy, I rediscovered my creativity through problem solving and design as I trained in full-stack web development with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, and Javascript for 6 months. What drew me to Ada was not only its strong curriculum, but its partnership with companies that are dedicated to diversity and investment in new talent. I completed the program through a 5-month internship at Microsoft. I am amazed by how having the skill of knowing how to code and how to learn to code can lead to so many powerful applications and wonderful avenues of communication. I look forward to working in an environment where I am constantly learning and becoming a master at my craft.
        <br/><br/>
        In my free time, I enjoy watching MasterChef in the hopes that I will one day gain cooking skills by osmosis, as well as watching and occasionally performing improv comedy.</p>
